# Basics of Cloud Computing

## Introduction
Cloud computing revolutionizes the way businesses and individuals access, manage, and utilize computing resources. This markdown file provides an overview of cloud computing, its benefits, and different deployment models.

## Key Concepts

- **24x7 Electricity Supply:** Cloud data centers ensure uninterrupted power supply, enabling continuous operation of services.

- **System Administration:** Cloud environments require a team of system administrators for regular resource updates, patch management, and maintenance.

- **Scalability:** Cloud infrastructure offers scalability, allowing users to easily increase or decrease computing resources based on demand.

- **Overheating:** Data centers implement cooling systems to prevent overheating and maintain optimal operating conditions.

- **Public Cloud:** Services provided over the internet by third-party providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), where users share resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.

## Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing involves accessing and managing computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, databases, software applications) over the internet. It eliminates the need for owning and maintaining physical hardware, offering scalability, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility.

- **Public Cloud:** Shared digital space accessible to everyone. Example: Google Drive, AWS.

- **Private Cloud:** Exclusive digital space for a specific organization. Example: Company-owned servers.

- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of private and public cloud, offering flexibility based on needs. Example: Using private cloud for sensitive data and public cloud for additional storage.

## Deployment Models

### Public Cloud
- **Who Uses It:** Individuals, businesses, organizations.
- **Description:** Giant shared computer space on the internet, accessible to everyone.
- **Example:** Google Drive, AWS.

### Private Cloud
- **Who Uses It:** Specific organization or business.
- **Description:** Personal, private digital space restricted to authorized users.
- **Example:** Company-owned servers.

### Hybrid Cloud
- **Who Uses It:** A mix of individuals, businesses, and organizations.
- **Description:** Combination of private and public cloud, providing flexibility.
- **Example:** Storing sensitive data privately and using public cloud for additional tasks.

## Conclusion

Cloud computing offers a flexible and cost-effective solution for accessing and managing computing resources. Understanding the different deployment models helps organizations choose the approach that best suits their needs and requirements.
